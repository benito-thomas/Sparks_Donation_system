                   A small amount can change the life of a child; through education, nutrition, and basic protection, children can lead normal lives. The adjacent graph is a representation of how we have utilised your donations.One in three of the world’s malnourished children live in India. Our children are going to school hungry. They suffer from lack of concentration and reduced cognitive development, directly leading to their dropping out of school. Join us in our mission to prevent hunger diminishing our children’s opportunities to succeed.
